# Kaitai UI Plugin (v1.1a)
Author: **Vector 35 Inc**
_Browse hex with a tree view populated from Kaitai Struct formats._
## Description:
This UI plugin allows you to browse a hex dump within Binary Ninja with a tree view informed by [Kaitai Struct](https://kaitai.io/).

This wires up Kaitai Struct as a parsing library to produce templated dissection of binary files. Of course, this concept itself isnâ€™t new. Plenty of great tools like 010, Hexinator and Synalyze It! have this feature (last two by the same company for different platforms). Thanks to the Kaitai Project not only for the project in general, but also for working with us to resolve some small issues while we were developing the plugin.
